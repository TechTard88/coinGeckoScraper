CoinGecko Scraper


READ ME:

This python program creates an array of coin objects. Right now it just scrapes every coin and then loops through printing all the info out to the console. Feel free to use this how ever you would like. 

  Be sure to use python 3!
  
  install modules:
    pip install pyquery
    pip install requests
